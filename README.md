# Overview

Welcome to my android notes app! This app is a simple android application that allows users to create, delete, and store notes on their android devices. I created this app so that I could learn a little more about android studio and diversify my development portfolio. I was very curious to learn about mobile app programming because there are so many things that we use our phones for every day that just don't require PC's to do.

# Development Environment

To develop this application I used Kotlin and Android Studio. I chose to use Kotlin because, from my research, it appeared to be the most modern language specific to android applications and it constantly receiving support and updates from some of the biggest names in the industry: JetBrains and Google. Because of this research I figured Kotlin would be a great skill to add to my portfolio. 

The Kotlin language relies heavily and several libraries which I implemented: android, androidx. These libraries are built in to Android Studio and make designing, mapping, planning, and building mobile applications much easier than using traditional Java.

# Future Work

* I would really like to implement a note editing function eventually.
* I would like to implement better error handling and validation as well.
